# KF1066

This repository contains crucial info for fixing several game breaking / game killing bugs.

I've made separate markdown documents for each exploit, so this doesn't become a mess and you could easily find the code.

## To Do

0. UPD: I'ts half finished and put into a stasis, since TWI doesn't care if this exists.
1. Accelerated players (jumps from several shit) accelerate them and lead to one hit zed kills.
2. Projectiles vs players / zeds.
