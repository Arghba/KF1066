This repository contains crucial info for fixing several game breaking / game killing bugs.

## To Do

0. UPD: I'ts half finished and put into a stasis, since TWI doesn't care if this exists.
1. Accelerated players (when you hug and jump on several collisions and accelerate from them) one hit kill *ANY* zed.
2. Projectiles vs players / zeds.
