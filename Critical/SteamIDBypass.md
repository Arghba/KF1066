# General Information
Everyone can easily modify this game's memory and use grandpa age aimbots, hack programms. I almost don't care since there is a kickvote / ban system, but recently lot's of people started to bypass server bans. They just start the CheatEngine (or similar programm, doesn't matter), change 1 byte in their **SteamID** and they are free to join. Tho this value is one of the most important parts of game, and somehow game doesn't punish you on this trick.

## Possible fixes
### If we are online
Simply recheck SteamID on every server connection, level change or rejoins. And if it differs from original value terminate the game session. Or even better VAC ban the faggot. It will be pretty fair against cheaters and keep our games not spoiled.
### IF we are offline
Just don't care at all, since they can't do much on solo.
