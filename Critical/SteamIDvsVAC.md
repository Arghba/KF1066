# General Information
In my honest opinion **VAC** is not even enabled in KF, because everyone can easily modify game memory and use grandpa age aimbots. I almost don't care since there is a kickvote / ban system, but recently lot's of people started to use this weakness to bypass the server bans. They just start the cheatengine (or similar programm, doesn't matter), change 1 byte in their **SteamID** and they are free to join. Tho this value is like the most important part of game, and somehow it doesn't punish you on this trick.

## Possible fixes
Simply recheck SteamID on every server connection, level change or rejoins. And if it differs from original value terminate the game session. It will be pretty fair against cheaters and keep our games not spoiled.
