# Genaral Information
1. Siren damages players after she is decapped (has - health).
2. Husk shoots fireball after he is dead.
3. Crawler has a collision issues.
4. Zed to zed damage spamms to log, a lot.

# Exploits reasons
1. `KFChar/ZombieSiren.uc#112 SpawnTwoShots()` has no checks if we are decapped or no.
```unrealscript
simulated function SpawnTwoShots()
{
    if( bZapped )
    {
        return;
    }
    ...
}
```
2. If `Husk` started his fireball launching animation nothing can interupt him. Even if you wipe him to meat and blood, fireball will be spawned anyways and does his job.
3. Crawler jumps very fast and his pawn is not being destroyed that quick to make the transition smooth.
4. `KFMod/KFMonster.uc#2631 TakeDamage()` lacks checks if damage was death by another zed.

## #1: Teamkills
Because we don't have some important checks inside `TakeDamage(...)` when some one shoots harpoon, orca granade, m99, xbow, flamethrower, etc and go to spectators quickly, projectile hits `Pawns` and *DEALS* damage like it was made by an enemy. It's being used to troll players a lot. Harpoon kills are easies to pull due to it's slow projectiles and delayed detonation.

[Video demonstration #1](STUB!)

## #2: Pipe Bomb Detonation
Almost similar to the last case, but happens due to `PipeBombProjecile`'s `TakeDamage(...)`. If do the same trick to your teammates pipes instead of his pawn, it will detonate and make the fly awayyy.

## #3: Nuka Pipes
Due to `PipeBombProjecile`'s `TakeDamage(...)` you can detonate them multiple times with high firerate weapons (like medguns, fal, etc and flamethrower, shotguns), and it will deal tremendous amount of damage - from 8k to 17k, depends how succesfull was your aim.
Aaaand besides that when multiple pipe bombs explode or you detonate one with methods described above - you will get huge log spam about out of bound sound array.

# Proposed solution
1. Since you are going to edit `KFPawn` to fix dosh exploits, you can simply:
```unrealscript
function TakeDamage(int Damage, Pawn instigatedBy, Vector hitlocation, Vector momentum, class<DamageType> damageType, optional int HitIdx )
{
	// local vars
	// before any calculation and even before super.TakeDamage()

	// just in case
   	if ( Damage <= 0 )
	   return; 

	// copy-pasted from KFHumanPawn to check for nones
	if( Controller!=None && Controller.bGodMode )
		return;

	KFDamType = class<KFWeaponDamageType>(damageType);
	if ( InstigatedBy == none )
	{
		// Player received non-zombie KF damage from unknown source.
		// Let's assume that it is friendly damage, e.g. from just
		disconnected/crashed/cheating teammate
		// and ignore it.
		if ( KFDamType != none && class<DamTypeZombieAttack (KFDamType) == none )
			return;
    }
	else
	{
		if ( KFMonster(InstigatedBy) != none )
		{
			KFMonster(InstigatedBy).bDamagedAPlayer = true;
		}
		else if( KFHumanPawn(InstigatedBy) != none )
		{
			InstigatorPRI = KFPlayerReplicationInfo(InstigatedBy.PlayerReplicationInfo);
			// Don't allow momentum from a player shooting a player
			Momentum = vect(0,0,0);
			// no damage from spectators (i.e. fire missile -> spectate -> missile hits player
			if ( InstigatorPRI != none && InstigatorPRI.bOnlySpectator )
				return;
		}
	
	// here starts your original kfpawn code
	...
}
```

2. 3.Additional checks for better damage detection and to allow it trigger only once.
```unrealscript
function TakeDamage( int Damage, Pawn InstigatedBy, Vector Hitlocation, Vector Momentum, class<DamageType> damageType, optional int HitIndex)
{
    if ( bTriggered || Damage < 5 )
        return;

    if ( Monster(InstigatedBy) == none && class<KFWeaponDamageType>(damageType) != none && class<KFWeaponDamageType>(damageType).default.bDealBurningDamage )
        return; // make pipebombs immune to fire, unless instigated by monsters

    super.TakeDamage(Damage, InstigatedBy, Hitlocation, Momentum, damageType, HitIndex);
}
```
