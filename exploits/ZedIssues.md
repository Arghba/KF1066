# Genaral Information
1. Siren damages players after she is decapped (has - health).
2. Husk shoots fireball after he is dead.
3. Crawler has collision issues.
4. Zed to zed damage spamms to log, a lot.
5. Fleshpound makes all zeds to spin like crazy.

# Exploits reasons
1. `KFChar/ZombieSiren.uc#112 SpawnTwoShots()` has no checks if we are decapped or no.
```unrealscript
simulated function SpawnTwoShots()
{
    if( bZapped )
    {
        return;
    }
    ...
}
```
2. If `Husk` started his fireball launching animation nothing can interupt him. Even if you wipe him to meat and blood, fireball will be spawned anyways and does his job.
3. Crawler jumps very fast and his pawn is not being destroyed that quick to make the transition smooth.
4. `KFMod/KFMonster.uc#2631 TakeDamage()`
```unrealscript
function TakeDamage(int Damage, Pawn instigatedBy, Vector hitlocation, Vector momentum, class<DamageType> damageType, optional int HitIndex )
{
    ...
    // 2nd check will spam log with none warnings if damage was dealth by a zed (no player pawn)
    if ( damageType != none && LastDamagedBy.IsPlayerPawn() && LastDamagedBy.Controller != none )
    {
        if ( KFMonsterController(Controller) != none )
        {
            KFMonsterController(Controller).AddKillAssistant(LastDamagedBy.Controller, FMin(Health, Damage));
        }
    }
    ...
}
```
5. `KFMod/FleshPoundAvoidArea.uc#41`
```unrealscript
function bool RelevantTo(Pawn P)
{
    // no zed health / specie check
    return ( KFMonst != none && VSizeSquared(KFMonst.Velocity) >= 75 && Super.RelevantTo(P)
    && KFMonst.Velocity dot (P.Location - KFMonst.Location) > 0  );
}
```

## #4: Zed2Zed Damage Log Spam

## #5: Fleshpound Spinning Madness
When you rage a FP it during it's animation all zeds that touch him will be spinned several times. This makes headshots much much harder to achieve, and for dual, triple FP's almost suicidal mission.
