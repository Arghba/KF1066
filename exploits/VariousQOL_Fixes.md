Here are some little thing that can be easily fixed and the won't break any mod compability or game mechanics.

# Buzzsaw Projectiles
### Genaral Information
Very often saws go out of map / areas where players can reach it, or players itself doesn't pick up them and refill in trader. This leads to tremandous sound spam. You can't destroy them in any way, and have to deal with sound spam for whole game.

### Proposed Solution
For level cleanup add this to `KFGameType` -> `State MatchInProgress` -> `#2308: CloseShops()`:
```unrealscript
local CrossbuzzsawBlade CrossbuzzsawBlade;

foreach DynamicActors(class'CrossbuzzsawBlade', CrossbuzzsawBlade)
{
  if(CrossbuzzsawBlade == none)
    continue;
  if(CrossbuzzsawBlade.ImpactActor != none)
    CrossbuzzsawBlade.Destroy();
}
```

# Grenade's Log Spam
### Genaral Information
If you throw even a single nade it will lead to log spam.

`Error: Nade KF-Corner3WaysFix.Nade (Function KFMod.Nade.Explode:0023) Accessed array 'ExplodeSounds' out of bounds (0/0)`

### Proposed Solution
1. `KFMod/Nade.uc#79` add a check if we have a corrupted array.
```unrealscript
simulated function Explode(vector HitLocation, vector HitNormal)
{
  ...
  // null reference fix
  if ( ExplodeSounds.length > 0 )
    PlaySound(ExplodeSounds[rand(ExplodeSounds.length)],,2.0);
  ...
 }
```
2. `KFMod/Nade.uc#380` convert `sound` to `SoundGroup`.
```unrealscript
defaultproperties
{
  ...
  ExplodeSounds(0)=SoundGroup'KF_GrenadeSnd.Nade_Explode_1'
  ExplodeSounds(1)=SoundGroup'KF_GrenadeSnd.Nade_Explode_2'
  ExplodeSounds(2)=SoundGroup'KF_GrenadeSnd.Nade_Explode_3'
}
```

# Pickup's Log Spam
### Genaral Information
**All** pickups that are thrown by a player (or else has `bDropped=true`) spam to log while being destroyed, because `KFMod/KFWeaponPickup.uc#412: Destroyed()` lacks checks if we have inventory or no.

`Warning: MK23Pickup KF-WinLondon.MK23Pickup (Function KFMod.KFWeaponPickup.Destroyed:0019) Accessed None 'Inventory'`

### Proposed Solution
`KFMod/KFWeaponPickup.uc#412: Destroyed()` add a check for `Inventory != none`.
```unrealscript
function Destroyed()
{
  if ( bDropped && Inventory != none && KFGameType(Level.Game) != none )
    KFGameType(Level.Game).WeaponDestroyed(class<Weapon>(Inventory.Class));

  super.Destroyed();
}
```

# Inadequate Match End
### Genaral Information
If a lone player joins to empty server as a spectator / usual player and then leave, game thinks that team is wiped and triggers voting -> map switch.

### Proposed Solution
Add an additional check to your `KFGameType` -> `#4736: CheckEndGame(...)` so lobby state will be excluded.
```unrealscript
function bool CheckEndGame(PlayerReplicationInfo Winner, string Reason)
{
  ...
  if(Level.Game.IsInState('PendingMatch'))
    return false;
  ...
}
```
